= Log4j Kotlin API

{project-name} provides a Kotlin-friendly interface to log against {log4j-api-url}[the Log4j API].
The minimum requirements are Java `{java-target-version}` and Kotlin `{kotlin-version}`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is just a logging API.
Your application still needs to have a logging backend (e.g., {log4j-url}[Log4j]) configured.
====

[#dependencies]
== Dependencies

You need to have the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api-kotlin` dependency in your classpath:

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j-api-kotlin</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Java module name and OSGi `Bundle-SymbolicName` are set to `org.apache.logging.log4j.api.kotlin`.

[#usage]
== Usage

You can start using the wrapper by extending from the provided `Logging` interface:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.Logging

class MyClass: BaseClass, Logging {

  fun doStuff() {
    logger.info("Doing stuff")
  }

  fun doStuffWithUser(user: User) {
    logger.info { "Doing stuff with ${user.name}." }
  }

}
----

The `Logging` interface can also be mixed into `object` declarations, including companions.
This is generally preferable over the previous approach as there is a single logger created for every instance of the class.

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.Logging

class MyClass: BaseClass {

  companion object : Logging

  // ...

}
----

Alternatively, a more traditional style can be used to instantiate a logger instance:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin

class MyClass: BaseClass {

  val logger = logger()

  // ...

}
----

The function `logger()` is an extension function on the `Any` type (or more specifically, any type `T` that extends `Any`).

Beginning in version 1.3.0, an extension property is also available on classes:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.logger

class MyClass: BaseClass {

  fun doStuff() {
    logger.info("Hello, world!")
  }

}
----

Also added in version 1.3.0, the `ThreadContext` API has two facade objects provided: `ContextMap` and `ContextStack`.

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.ContextMap
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.ContextStack

ContextMap["key"] = "value"
assert(ContextMap["key"] == "value")
assert("key" in ContextMap)

ContextMap += "anotherKey" to "anotherValue"
ContextMap -= "key"

ContextStack.push("message")
assert(!ContextStack.empty)
assert(ContextStack.depth == 1)
val message = ContextStack.peek()
assert(message == ContextStack.pop())
assert(ContextStack.empty)
----

[#params]
== Parameter substitution

Unlike Java, Kotlin provides native functionality for https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html#using-string-templates[string templates].
However, using a string template still incurs the message construction cost if the logger level is not enabled.
To avoid this, prefer passing a lambda which won't be evaluated until necessary:

[source,kotlin]
----
logger.debug { "Logging in user ${user.name} with birthday ${user.calcBirthday()}" }
----

[#logger-names]
== Logger names

Most logging implementations use a hierarchical scheme for matching logger names with logging configuration.

In this scheme the logger name hierarchy is represented by `.` (dot) characters in the logger name, in a fashion very similar to the hierarchy used for Java/Kotlin package names.
The `Logger` property added by the `Logging` interface follows this convention: the interface ensures the `Logger` is automatically named according to the class it is being used in.

The value returned when calling the `logger()` extension method depends on the receiver of the extension.
When called within an object, the receiver is `this` and therefore the logger will again be named according to the class it is being used in.
However, a logger named via another class can be obtained as well:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin

class MyClass: BaseClass {

  val logger = SomeOtherClass.logger()

  // ...

}
----

[#explicitly-named-loggers]
=== Explicitly Named Loggers

An explicitly-named logger may be obtained via the `logger` function that takes a `name` parameter:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin

class MyClass: BaseClass {

  val logger = logger("MyCustomLoggerName")

  // ...

}
----

This is also needed in scopes that do not have a `this` object, such as top-level functions.

[#development]
== Development

{project-name} uses {project-github-url}[GitHub] for source code management.

The project requires a Java compiler matching the `{java-compiler-version}` range and targets Java `{java-target-version}` and Kotlin `{kotlin-version}`.

You can build and verify sources using:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw verify
----

You can build and view the website as follows:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -N site
python -m http.server -d target/site
----
