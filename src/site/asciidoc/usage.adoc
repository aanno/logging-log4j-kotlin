== Usage

Using the Kotlin API is as simple as mixing in the https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j-kotlin/blob/master/log4j-api-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/org/apache/logging/log4j/kotlin/Logging.kt[`Logging`] interface to your class. Example:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.Logging

class MyClass: BaseClass, Logging {
  fun doStuff() {
    logger.info("Doing stuff")
  }
  fun doStuffWithUser(user: User) {
    logger.info { "Doing stuff with ${user.name}." }
  }
}
----

The `Logging` interface can also be mixed into `object` declarations, including companions. This is generally preferable over the previous approach as there is a single logger created for every instance of the class.

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.Logging

class MyClass: BaseClass {
  companion object : Logging

  // ...
}
----

Alternatively, a more traditional style can be used to instantiate a logger instance:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin

class MyClass: BaseClass {
  val logger = logger()

  // ...
}
----

The function `logger()` is an extension function on the `Any` type (or more specifically, any type `T` that extends `Any`).

Beginning in version 1.3.0, an extension property is also available on classes:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.logger

class MyClass: BaseClass {
  fun doStuff() {
    logger.info("Hello, world!")
  }
}
----

Also added in version 1.3.0, the `ThreadContext` API has two facade objects provided: `ContextMap` and `ContextStack`.

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.ContextMap
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin.ContextStack

ContextMap["key"] = "value"
assert(ContextMap["key"] == "value")
assert("key" in ContextMap)

ContextMap += "anotherKey" to "anotherValue"
ContextMap -= "key"

ContextStack.push("message")
assert(!ContextStack.empty)
assert(ContextStack.depth == 1)
val message = ContextStack.peek()
assert(message == ContextStack.pop())
assert(ContextStack.empty)
----


=== API Documentation

See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/kotlin/log4j-api-kotlin/org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin/[KDocs].

=== Configuration

Log4j Kotlin API uses https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[Log4j configuration] by default.

This supports XML, properties files, and Java-based builders, as well as JSON and YAML with additional dependencies.

=== Substituting Parameters

Unlike Java, Kotlin provides native functionality for https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html#using-string-templates[string templates].

However, using a string template still incurs the message construction cost if the logger level is not enabled. To avoid this, prefer passing a lambda which won't be evaluated until necessary.

For example:

[source,kotlin]
----
logger.debug { "Logging in user ${user.name} with birthday ${user.calcBirthday()}" }
----

=== Logger Names

Most logging implementations use a hierarchical scheme for matching logger names with logging configuration.

In this scheme the logger name hierarchy is represented by '.' characters in the logger name, in a fashion very similar to the hierarchy used for Java/Kotlin package names.

The `Logger` property added by the `Logging` interface follows this convention: the interface ensures the `Logger` is automatically named according to the class it is being used in.

The value returned when calling the `logger()` extension method depends on the receiver of the extension. When called within an Object as shown above, the receiver is `this` and therefore the logger will again be named according to the class it is being used in. However, a logger named via another class can be obtained as well:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin

class MyClass: BaseClass {
  val logger = SomeOtherClass.logger()

  // ...
}
----

==== Explicitly Named Loggers

An explicitly-named logger may be obtained via the `logger` function that takes a `name` parameter:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.kotlin

class MyClass: BaseClass {
  val logger = logger("MyCustomLoggerName")

  // ...
}
----

This is also needed in scopes that do not have a `this` Object, such as top-level functions.
